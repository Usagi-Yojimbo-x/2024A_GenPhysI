## Getting Started

### Installing and Running Projects

- Create a new `venv`
- Install all required packages through:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- Run individual projects through:
```bash
python3 <project name>
```

> Developed on Python 3.12.3

## Overview

### Introduction

Included in this repo are two Python projects about gravitational pull and n-body problem.

)

## Gravitational Pull Simulation

### Controls

- Add another celestial body (comet) by pressing letter `K`.
- Scale down or up by pressing `Cmd/Ctrl` + `+/-`.
- Change the timescale by adjusting `TIMESTEP` (in seconds) in the beginning of the project file.
- You can adjust the mass of each celestial body in the source code to see the change in the simulation

## N-body Problem Simulation

### Controls

- After each run an image with the results of the simulation will be saved in the project's directory under `nbody.png`.
